title: Twitter Web Night Mode
type: app
layout: default
summary: Twitter's official apps for Android and iOS have an option to switch to `night mode` which uses a dark color scheme. As on date, Twitter doesn't seem to bring this to their web app. So I built an extension for Chrome & Firefox which does this.

# Twitter Web Night Mode

I have been using the night mode on twitter's Android app ever since it was released and noticed that a lot of people are loving it. I thought it would be a good idea to build a browser extension to bring the night mode to twitter's web app.

This is my first personal project for public use and as of this writing, the extension has about 1300 users on Chrome and 135 users on Firefox. Lot of good people have given encouraging reviews both on Chrome Web Store & twitter.

I wrote about it in detail [here]({% post_url 2016-08-24-bringing-twitter-night-mode-to-web %}).
